# Neopad

## Overview

Neopad is a little macropad with four switches and two rotary encoders, made by through hole components only. It's designed to use [QMK](https://qmk.fm/) firmware.
_Actually the number of switches is six, because even the encoder are allowed to click._

The Neopad in the photo above is the first prototype with ultra light case made from biscuits cardboard. In this repo you can find the final revision including:

+ fixed reset button pin routing
+ fixed positioning of mounting holes
+ added breakable PCB for EOTW case
+ new shiny artwork

Read the full development log on my website: ~~[rookiebwoy.eu](https://www.rookiebwoy.eu/projects/neopad/neopad.html)~~ [ivndbt.com](https://ivndbt.com/makes/neopad/neopad.html).


## In this repo

Here you can find my KiCad project files and the gerbers I used to manufacture the Neopad.
In order to open and modify them you will need to download and add the [keebio-components](https://github.com/keebio/keebio-components.git) symbols library to the project's path.

## Description

+ The 2 LEDs rappresent the current layer in binary (max 4 layers rappresented but, accordingly with [QMK capabilities](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/software-features/feature_layers), you can program up to 16 layers)
+ Total PCB dimensions are 99.22mm x 87.31mm
+ Macropad dimensions after build are 99.22mm x 42.86mm

## References

I decided to open source this project because I wanted to give back to the amazing mechanical keyboard comunity what was given to me. I owe special mention to the following links that I found extremely useful and that without them I could never achieve this:

+ the keyboard designer wiki [@ ai03.com](https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/chapter/pcb-designer-guide) for KiCad's tutorial
+ Chokkan's [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HLV6mUxNnU) for setting up QMK's developing environment
+ imchipwood's [dumbpad macropad](https://github.com/imchipwood/dumbpad) for encoder's routing, LED's behavior, QMK and readme structure
